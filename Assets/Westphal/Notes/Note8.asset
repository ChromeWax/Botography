  _description: "[The note is somehow unburned by the heat of the volcano]\r\n\r\nIt's
    no white whale. The Panacean plants are real! Albeit, in a different form than
    in the ancient past. They\u2019ve for some reason have hidden themselves deep
    on the island. There are strange powers at work here, different from anything
    I\u2019ve seen in my decades of biology field work. The ecosystem is reacting
    incredibly quickly to our meddling, as if the island itself is alive! \r"
