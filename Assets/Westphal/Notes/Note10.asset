  _description: "[A piece of scrapbooking paper lays in the grass, a floral pattern
    decorates the border of the sheet. It smells like lavender.]\r\n\r\nTo protect
    us, the trees grew taller and the canopies thickened. They hide us from sight,
    but we want to see the night sky again!\r\nGo to the brightest place you can
    find, and your light will grow.\r\nA good base of <color=#7B3F00>silt</color>,
    some <color=#4682B4>water</color>, and a seed is all you need. \r"
