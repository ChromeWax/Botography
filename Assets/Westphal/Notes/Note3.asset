  _description: The pollution is making it hard for the workers to breathe, but the
    plants seem to be doing just fine. One moment, the foliage is withering. But
    the next thing you know, they just grow back even healthier! If we could just
    get our hands on whatever keeps them going, we'll be filthy rich!
