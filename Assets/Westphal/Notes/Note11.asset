  _description: "[A postcard from the city you grew up in is stuck in the exact center
    of a spider web. It dated many years before you were born.]\n\r\n\r\nDear fellow
    traveler,\r\nI took a tour around your home town once! It\u2019s nice to see
    places different from where you grew up, just don\u2019t make a mess of someone
    else's home. Try using this!\r\nPlant in half sun, on a clay river bank or beach.\r\nWater
    using basic or neutral water only.\r\n"
