  _description: "[The note has frozen into a rigid plate]\r\n\r\nThe southeastern
    region has been one big snag after another. The men were issued standard equipment
    for tropical operations. It\u2019s safe to say that we didn\u2019t expect to
    need winter coats. Those eggheads could\u2019ve been a bit more descriptive than
    \u201Cunusual weather events\u201D. I\u2019m not risking anyone\u2019s life to
    hypothermia, for now all operations will be limited to the western part of the
    island. \r"
