  _description: "[A half burned scrap of paper lays in the ash]\r\n\r\nThe  smell
    of sulfur has been getting worse by the day. I told the higher ups that my men
    can\u2019t keep working like this, we\u2019re on our third batch of pickaxes!
    They\u2019re rusting faster than they should, our tools are falling apart under
    their own weight. My guys aren\u2019t pansies and neither am I, but if they don\u2019t
    tell us what we\u2019re digging for, I\u2019ll\u2026\r\n\r\n[The note is burned
    past legibility]\r"
