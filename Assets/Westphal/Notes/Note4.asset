  _description: "Alright, that\u2019s enough. At this rate, the swamp is swallowing
    our machines faster than we can replace them! We can only thank our lucky stars
    it hasn\u2019t gobbled up my crew as well.\r\nI still don\u2019t know what\u2019s
    going on with this place, but I ain\u2019t sticking around to find out. We\u2019re
    packing up whatever equipment is left and will be heading back to the boat before
    sundown. \r\nThis whole project was a complete disaster\u2026\r"
