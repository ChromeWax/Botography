  _description: '[The campfire remains warm to the touch.]



    A common trope
    in ancient mythology is that of a lost island containing the key to eternal life.
    The fountain of youth, The Greek Crumissa, and the Celtic Tir fo Thuinn. These
    are stories older than storybooks themselves. Modern scientists have estimated
    these places to be all over the globe. What if this was a single location that
    appeared at different points in history in different locations?'
