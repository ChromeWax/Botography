  _description: "The director of the project has ordered all operations cease immediately
    and for everyone to return to the mainland. There\u2019s nothing anyone here
    can do to fix the mess we made. If I could just get my hands on a sample before
    I head back to the boat. No one is crazy enough to go down into the caldera,
    it's too hot for any of our protective equipment to work. How could a plant survive
    in such heat?\r"
