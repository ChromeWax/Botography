  _description: "Back on the boat, we took a look at the genes of the plants from
    different parts of the island. They all have some sort of genetic connection
    to each other, a common ancestor perhaps. One result of this fascinating anomaly
    is that they are all highly photosensitive, and will only grow on certain parts
    of the island where the light is just right. \r\n\r\n[The author details plans
    similar to the sun-o-meter you are carrying in your lab.]\r"
