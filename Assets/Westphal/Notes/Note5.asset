  _description: "Another excavator got sunk this morning. The ground was stable one
    minute, and then collapsed in seconds! \r\nWe\u2019ve been here for weeks, how
    did no one notice the deterioration in the inspections? It\u2019s not like the
    dirt can just magically turn to mud when it feels like it, right?\r\nOn top of
    all that, one of our oil rigs just started sinking out of nowhere a few minutes
    ago. At this rate, we\u2019ll be trudging back to the boat on foot by tomorrow\u2026.\r"
