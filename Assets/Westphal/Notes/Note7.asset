  _description: "We\u2019ve analyzed the <color=#7B3F00>soil</color> of the island
    and have classified it into four types: Loam, Sand, Clay, and Silt. Along with
    this, we\u2019ve detected an anomalous amount of biodiversity among the insect
    population. The island has been found to have non-standard geologic features,
    strange plateaus and chasms. And despite no known fault lines beneath this area,
    it's volcanically active! I can\u2019t wait to test the water hardness and salinity\u2026
