  _description: "All personnel notice:\r\nWhile technically very clean, the waters
    have been found to have wildly varying pH levels. For example, the water in the
    volcanic region has been found to be both highly basic and acidic in spots. It
    is extremely abnormal for the levels to be so different in such a small area,
    especially with our proximity to sea level. For now all water will come from
    the holding area in the southwest region. \r"
