  _description: "\rThe Greeks believed there was a mythical potion that could cure
    all diseases and grant immortal life, held by the goddess Panacea.  Ancient scholars
    studied and documented several plant species that they claimed were sent by this
    goddess. I debunked most of these ridiculous claims in my thesis, yet there remains
    some evidence in ancient texts of another species not yet documented by modern
    biologists. "
