  _description: "I\u2019ve finally spoken with the director of the project and received
    my new orders, if you can even call it that. Radio is still down, so I had to
    wait for a letter to arrive from the mainland. At least the generators are still
    running, so we aren\u2019t completely in the dark. This operation has been one
    snag after another. Now I\u2019ve been told that there\u2019s some electrical
    field around site 01 with \u201Cunknown hazardous properties\u201D, whatever
    that means. "
