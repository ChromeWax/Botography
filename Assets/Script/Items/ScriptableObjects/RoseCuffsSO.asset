  _description: "I believe that in addition to the larger thorns, the Rose Fringe
    has millions of tiny thorns that shred even the most terrifying of brambles.
    Incredibly, it only seems to react to things as sharp as it, meaning I\u2019m
    able to not only safely handle it, but strap it around my waist for protection!"
