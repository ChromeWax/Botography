  _description: "This pitcher plant is remarkably similar to the species encountered
    in most regions of the outside world, but this one seems to be able to digest
    literally anything. I haven\u2019t seen a plant that can eat solid rock before\u2026
    I wonder how it avoids eating itself???"
