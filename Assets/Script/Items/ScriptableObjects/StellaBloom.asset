  _description: "I\u2019ve been calling it Stella Bloom, because its pollen seems
    to somehow bioluminesce all on its own. In its natural habitat it lights up the
    pitch black like a starry night. The pollen seems to form into patterns like
    constellations and galaxies I\u2019ve seen in pictures\u2026 maybe it\u2019s
    my imagination."
