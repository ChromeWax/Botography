  _description: The petals of the Phoenix Rose seem to absorb immense amounts of
    heat. Its natural habitat is the perfect place to do this, because lava is hot.
    The petals themselves cannot survive outside of intense heat, they just sorta
    turn to ash. However, when returned to the soil of the volcanic crater, a new
    Phoenix Rose grows quickly from the ashes.
