  _description: "The mirror surface of this organism reflects all attempts at probing
    I\u2019ve tried. Visual inspection doesn\u2019t work too well, as I\u2019m just
    looking right back at myself. The longer I stare at myself, the weirder things
    get! Sometimes the reflection looks off\u2026 like it\u2019s me from a different
    universe. Other times, my reflection seems to lag behind for a second. I suspect
    that the Mirror Moss had a kind of temporal effect, like an organic time machine!"
