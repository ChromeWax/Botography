  _description: "I\u2019m amazed at how fast what I call the Osmosis Lotus can remove
    toxins from its environment. It\u2019s different from any plant I\u2019ve seen
    before, even since coming to the island. I suspect this plant came into existence
    long ago and has laid dormant until the drilling began. It\u2019s almost like
    the island itself is trying to clean up our mess."
